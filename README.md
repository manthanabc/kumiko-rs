# kumiko-rs

kumiko clone, written in rust ~200% faster than original, slight difference in panel detection and cli parameters
mostly generated with gemini-cli
soon direct wasm integration and if possible no-std (so it can be used in embedded devices like ereaderes) 

libkumiko
extensible lib for using the comic clipper
